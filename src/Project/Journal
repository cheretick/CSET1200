    - Started working on the project.

    - Proposed Data Structure of Array: arr[5][10]
        {{Prof1Year1$$, Prof1Year2$$, Prof1Year3$$, ..., Prof1Year10$$},
         {Prof2Year1$$, Prof2Year2$$, Prof2Year3$$, ..., Prof2Year10$$},
         ...
         {Prof5Year1$$, Prof5Year2$$, Prof5Year3$$, ..., Prof5Year10$$}}

    - Made dummy main method, consisting of undefined methods.

    - Created a ProfessorsSalaries class, consisting of a constructor method which populates an array using
        parameters for its two dimension sizes, the number of professors and the number of years. The constructor then
        populates the array with random amounts representing salaries between $50,000 and $500,000.

    - Implemented a method to print the data in the array.
