    - Started working on the project.

    - Added project to my GitHub repository (better safe than sorry)

    - Proposed Data Structure of Array: arr[5][10]
        {{Prof1Year1$$, Prof1Year2$$, Prof1Year3$$, ..., Prof1Year10$$},
         {Prof2Year1$$, Prof2Year2$$, Prof2Year3$$, ..., Prof2Year10$$},
         ...
         {Prof5Year1$$, Prof5Year2$$, Prof5Year3$$, ..., Prof5Year10$$}}

    - Made dummy main method, consisting of undefined methods.

    - Created a ProfessorsSalaries class, consisting of a constructor method which populates an array using
        parameters for its two dimension sizes, the number of professors and the number of years. The constructor then
        populates the array with random amounts representing salaries between $50,000 and $500,000.

    - Implemented a method to print the data in the array.

    - Defined the method lowestSalary that returns the index of the professor with the lowest total salary

    - Defined the average method that returns the average salary made by all of the professors over ten years

    - I just realized that my print function is only returning the salaries made in the first five years..
        - Debugging:
        - Double checked that my constructor is indeed populating all ten years with random salaries
        - Realized that my constructor contained "this.numberOfYears = numberOfProfessors;"
            instead of "this.numberOfYears = numberOfYears;"
        - replacing numberOfProfessors with numberOfYears did in fact fix the issue

    - Defined the lowestSalaryYear method that returns the year in which the lowest single salary was earned

    - I realized that my average method already calculated the total amount of money, which is what I needed for
        my total method, except that it divided the total by the number of professors before returning the value.
        The only thing I needed to do to define the total method was to copy the lowestSalary method and return the
        total, without dividing it by the number of professors.

    - In order to make checking my work easier, I implemented a method which prints each professor's total pay
        - Using a calculator and this method, I verified that all of the data seems to be calculated correctly
