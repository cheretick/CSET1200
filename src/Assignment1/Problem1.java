    Summary: This program outputs sections of the syllabus

This code is my own work. I did not get any help from any online source
such as chegg.com; from a classmate, or any other person other than the instructor
or TA for this course. I understand that getting outside help from this course
other than from the instructor or TA will result in a grade of 0 in this
assignment and other disciplinary actions for academic dishonesty. */
